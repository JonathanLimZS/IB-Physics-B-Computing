I set myself the following additional goal (devised by me):

I noticed that much of the code that was written for Session 1 was applicable to Session 2, as I had already included concepts on control flow and variable assignment in my previous assignment. As such, I've re-factored my original code to tackle the problem of printing all prime numbers that are less than or equal to N. My algorithm's time complexity is not that impressive [O(n^2)] and I do realise that a faster algorithm is available, which is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. However, I chose to use the former to practice on using the logic behind nested 'for' loops.

My solution is in a file called PrimeNumbers.cc
