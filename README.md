# IB-Physics-B-Computing
Computational Project for Michaelmas Term 

This is an ongoing self-assessed project, thaat spans the entirety of Michaelmas Term 2019. There are 6 sessions in total.

I've had some background in using Java, so the code that I've submitted for the earlier sessions definitely exceeded the required use of concepts. 

Session 1: Introduction to C++. Input/Output streams.

Session 2: Assignment of variables, Control Flow (if/else/elseif, switch, for/while loops).
Used an O(n^2) algorithm for this session to incorporate the concept of nested 'for' loops, but this problem can definitely be solved using a faster algorithm (Sieve of Eratosthenes).
