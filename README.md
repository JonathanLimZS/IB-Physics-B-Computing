Computational Project for Michaelmas Term 

Session 1: Introduction to C++. Input/Output streams.

Session 2: Assignment of variables, Control Flow (if/else/elseif, switch, for/while loops).
Used an O(n^2) algorithm for this session to incorporate the concept of nested 'for' loops, but this problem can definitely be solved using a faster algorithm (Sieve of Eratosthenes).
